# ☁️ Exploring Data in Microsoft Azure

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience exploring and analyzing **relational**, **non-relational**, and **analytical datasets** using Microsoft Azure. It focuses on the use of core services such as **Azure SQL Database**, **Azure Cosmos DB**, **Azure Synapse Analytics**, and **Azure Data Explorer**, covering the lifecycle of data from ingestion to insights.

## 🧭 Project Focus Areas

### 🔷 1. Explore Relational Data in Azure
- Used **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Data Studio** to connect, query, and analyze structured datasets.
- Wrote optimized **T-SQL** statements to filter, aggregate, and join multiple tables.
- Created **views** and **stored procedures** for reusable data access layers.

### 🔶 2. Explore Non-Relational Data in Azure
- Utilized **Azure Cosmos DB (Core SQL API)** to handle hierarchical and document-based data (JSON).
- Created **NoSQL queries** to explore product catalogs, user profiles, and activity logs.
- Designed **partition strategies** and applied indexing policies for performance tuning.

### 🔷 3. Explore Data Analytics in Azure
- Built an end-to-end **data pipeline** using:
  - **Azure Data Factory** for ingestion and transformation
  - **Azure Synapse Analytics** for enterprise-scale querying and modeling
  - **Power BI** for visual reporting and insights
- Implemented **data lake architecture** using **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**

## 🌍 Large Data Events and Insights

- 📈 **Global E-commerce Spike in Q4**  
  Identified through Synapse queries on transactional data, with North America showing a 40% revenue increase during November and December.

- 🔄 **Unstructured Feedback Driving Product Updates**  
  Cosmos DB analysis of customer reviews revealed frequent complaints about specific features, informing product roadmap changes.

- 🏭 **Sensor Data from IoT Devices Shows Maintenance Cycles**  
  Azure Data Explorer analytics revealed periodic patterns in telemetry data, helping improve machine maintenance forecasting.

- 🔒 **Relational & Non-Relational Integration Enables 360° Customer View**  
  Combined structured sales data (SQL) and unstructured user behavior (Cosmos DB) for holistic user analytics.
